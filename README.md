# Culture-Generator
Generate culture, history, events, and basic stat blocks for individuals important for a culture

Copyright (c) William J. Thompson
Version 0.2.5 (September 2023)

This tool currently generates headlines, quests, names, and will eventually
generate both stat blocks and a timeline using metrics to influence what is
most likely to occur. It generates unique names using Markov chains.

For now, enjoy the headlines.
