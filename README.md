I started this project in May 2023 because I couldn't find a suitable
history or event generator for my D&D 5e (Dungeons and Dragons 5th
edition) game settings. This tool generates loads of mundane
headlines, and will eventually generate a timeline that uses metrics
to influence what events are most likely to occur. It will also
provide unique names for places, people, locations, etc. and basic
stats.

For now, enjoy the random mundane headlines.

If for some reason you really REALLY really want to contact me, send
it to william dot thompsonj at gmail dot com. Thanks.
